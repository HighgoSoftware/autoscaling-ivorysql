# Autoscaling â€” dev branch

This branch exists only to track what's currently deployed to the dev-us-east-2-beta cluster.

We don't *quite* use the release yaml files directly, because there are some config differences that
we want to preserve.

Currently these are:

```js
// Scheduler:
config.nodeDefaults.computeUnit = { "vCPUs": 1, "mem": 4 }
// Agent:
config.billing = {
      "url": "http://neon-internal-api.aws.neon.build/billing/api/v1",
      "cpuMetricName": "effective_compute_seconds",
      "activeTimeMetricName": "active_time_seconds",
      "collectEverySeconds": 5,
      "pushEverySeconds": 30,
      "pushTimeoutSeconds": 2
}
```
